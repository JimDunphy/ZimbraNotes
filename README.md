# Zimbra Community Documentation

This repository is intended as a home for community-driven documentation, technical notes, and guides related to Zimbra and its ecosystem. Over time, it became clear that relying solely on external wikis could result in important FOSS-related content being lost. To ensure long-term availability, this space will serve as a dedicated archive for new articles, updates, and insights.

While past contributions were published on **wiki.zimbra.com**, recent changes to that platform mean not all community materials will remain available there. Going forward, this repository will provide a reliable, transparent, and version-controlled location for ongoing documentation efforts.

The goal is to preserve technical knowledge, share practical experience, and create a resource that can grow with the needs of administrators, developers, and users of Zimbra. Contributions, improvements, and discussions are welcome.
